# Meta-Learning-for-AutoML
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) to automate the process of selecting the best machine learning models and hyperparameters for a given dataset. TPOT leverages genetic algorithms to search for the optimal machine learning pipeline, saving time and effort in model selection and tuning.

In this example, the Iris dataset is used to showcase TPOTâ€™s capabilities. However, the framework can be easily extended to other datasets with minimal changes.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.x
TPOT
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
You can install these libraries using the following command:

bash
pip install tpot scikit-learn pandas

Project Structure
TPOT_for_AutoML.ibynp: The main script that implements the TPOT AutoML framework.
best_model_pipeline.py: A Python file automatically generated by TPOT containing the best model pipeline.

How It Works
Data Preparation:
The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets to ensure proper evaluation of the models.

AutoML with TPOT:
TPOT explores a variety of models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) and performs hyperparameter tuning using genetic algorithms. The models are evaluated using cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

Pipeline Export:
The best-performing model pipeline is exported to a Python script (best_model_pipeline.py), making it easy to reuse or deploy the model.

Evaluation:
The accuracy of the selected model is tested on the test dataset, and the results are displayed in the console.

Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Replace the dataset or modify the data preparation steps if using a custom dataset.
Run the automl_tpot.py script to initiate the AutoML process.
View the test accuracy in the terminal and use the exported best_model_pipeline.py for deployment or further experimentation.
Customization
Dataset: Replace the default Iris dataset with your own by updating the data loading logic in the script.
Hyperparameters: Adjust TPOT parameters like generations, population_size, and cv to control the search space and computational time.
Evaluation Metric: TPOT defaults to optimizing accuracy. You can modify this to other metrics (e.g., F1-score) as needed.
Expected Results
After completing the AutoML process, TPOT will output the best-performing model pipeline and its accuracy on the test data. The exported Python file can be used directly to train and evaluate the model on other datasets or in production.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how TPOT simplifies the machine learning workflow by automating model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It is a powerful tool for quick experimentation, and the exported pipelines allow for easy deployment.
